# Bank Churn Data Analysis

This is a personal project to showcase the skills I learned from data analysis in DataCamp.

I used MySQL as my query language for this project.

[Dataset can be download here](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/bank-customer-churn)

### Barn Churn Cleaning File

Obviously, this file is for data cleaning. Upon exploring the dataset, I found some Surnames having a first letter followed by question mark (?). 
That's why the only data cleaning I queried there was only to eliminate those data.

1. Churn rate percentage distribution by geographical region
